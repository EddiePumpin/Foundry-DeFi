We are going to create a stable that is

1. Relative stability: Anchored or Pegged -> USD (This is achieveable with chainlink pricefeed)
   1. Get chainlink pricefeed,
   2. Set a function to exchange $ETH or $BTC to equivalent stablecoin
2. Stability Mechanism (Minting): Algorithmic (Decentralized)
   1. People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral (coded)
3. Collateral: Exogenous (Crypto: wETH and wBTC)

Integration test with deploy script and unit test with your contract
